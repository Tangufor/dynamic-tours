          <li id="1">There are a total of 12 tours every day, each running at a 30-minute interval. The first tour
            begins at 9:00am. The duration of each tour is 2 hours 30 minutes, with the last tour ending at 5:30pm</li><br>
          <li id="2">It is entirely up to you. We offer very flexible tours and so you may hop out at any time during the tour at any
              of the stops. Please note that once you hop out of a tour prior to its conclusion, you may be charged a fee
              if you wish to resume from where you left off with the next trolley. However availability is not guaranteed.</li><br>
          <li id="3">Yes! Our app provides simultaneous narrations in 8 other languages including Spanish, French,
            Russian, Mandarine/Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. Just plug in your headphone - available free of charge. The app
            is GPS enable, thus offering tour narrations by location as we proress in the tour. Please note that live narrations
            are available only in English.</li><br>
          <li id="4">Our highly enhanced app has real time weather forecasts. We let our tourists know what times it is going to rain
            or snow. We provide free raincoats to our tourists during periods of light or mild rainfall for those on the trolleys. However, we will not take you
            out there in inclement whether. During severe storms or heavy downpour, you have the option to continue the tour in our buses or have our buses pick you
            up at where you left off, and your tour could be rescheduled from where you left off.</li><br>
          <li id="5">The maximum persons per booking is 20 (including children). However you can always have multiple bookings if your
            party is larger than 20 and we will do our best to accomodate your needs. Please note that due to the limited number o seats per trolley,
            larger groups may be split in separate tours.</li><br>
          <li id="6">Our cancellation policy is pretty flexible. We offer 100% refund for cancellations made at least 3 days in advance, and 50% refund
            for any cancellations within the 3 day period but prior to the beginning of the tour.</li><br>
          <li id="7">We try to make our customers feel as confortable as possible. We offer free maps of the city so you can see
            where you are during the tour. We also offer free headphone devices for the hearing impaired or for those who speak other languages
            so they can listen to narrations straight from their smartphones. Popcorn and soft drinks are sold on board at discounted prices.</li><br>
          <li id="8">Unfortunately, we do not accept food or drinks into the trolleys. You may buy discounted snacks on board during the tour at any of the stops.</li>
